# :crystal_ball: Quiz App

> This repository is created by using HTML5, Styled Components,Typescript and ReactJS .
> One of the main outcomes of this project is figuring out how to create, explore and run a web application in a development environment, then deploying it to the production environment in accordance with **Test-Driven-Development(TDD)** approach.

>Thanks to this application, the user can chat with the person whoever they want after google auth, even if they are online later, they can review the messages again, as the previous messages are saved in the database, and delete the messages they do not want.

## Technology-Tool-Stack

- **React** : React. js is an open-source JavaScript library that is used for building user interfaces specifically for single-page applications. It's used for handling the view layer for web and mobile apps. React also allows us to create reusable UI components.

- **Styled Components** : styled-components utilises tagged template literals to style your components. It removes the mapping between components and styles. This means that when you're defining your styles, you're actually creating a normal React component, that has your styles attached to it..

- **TypeScript** : TypeScript is a programming language developed and maintained by Microsoft. It is a strict syntactical superset of JavaScript and adds optional static typing to the language. TypeScript is designed for development of large applications and transcompiles to JavaScript. As TypeScript is a superset of JavaScript, existing JavaScript programs are also valid TypeScript programs.
